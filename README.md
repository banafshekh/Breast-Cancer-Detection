# Breast-Cancer-Detection
In the first project, I trained a very simple model to estimate the number of layers, hyper parameters, preprocessing mehods, which are needed to reach a higher accuracy.
In the second one (BCD2), the accuracy result had a considerable rise to 83%. however, the project has not been completed yet.
