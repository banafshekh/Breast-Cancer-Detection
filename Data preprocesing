Data Preprocessing

For every image, the following preprocessing steps were applied:

    Resize the image to have a shape of (240, 240, 3)=(image_width, image_height, number of channels): to feed images with the same size in the neural network.
    Apply normalization: devid all of pixels into 255, so we will have a pixel between 0 and 1.
